## Frontend Overview
The user frontend is developed using React, enabling users to browse products, add items to the shopping cart, proceed to checkout using their account, and track order statuses. Here's an example of navigating through the frontend:
1. Home Page: Displays featured products and navigation links.
2. Product Listings: Lists skincare products with details and "Add to Cart" option.
3. Shopping Cart: Shows added items, allows quantity adjustments, and provides checkout option.
4. Checkout: Requires user login, shipping information, and payment details for order confirmation.
5. Order Tracking: Users can track their orders and view current statuses (pending, shipped, delivered).
